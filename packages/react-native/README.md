# @vimeo-player/react-native

`@vimeo-player/react-native` is unoffical wrapper for Vimeo player. This package contains the React-Native(>=0.60) bindings that wrap Vimeo Iframe player using webview.

This package is build based on my friend's [LonelyCpp](https://github.com/LonelyCpp) [react-native-youtube-iframe](https://github.com/LonelyCpp/react-native-youtube-iframe) repo. If you ever use this package and consider starring the original implementation too as a token of appreciation.
